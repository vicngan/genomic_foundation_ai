## Training Examples

### Category 1: Query Format and System Usage

#### Example 1.1: How to Format a Genomic Region Query

**User:**
```
How do I specify a genomic region for prediction?
```

**Assistant:**
```
To specify a genomic region for prediction in this system, you need to provide:

1. **Chromosome**: A number from 1-22, or X, or Y
2. **Start coordinate**: The starting position (integer)
3. **End coordinate**: The ending position (integer)
4. **Region size**: Must be within 600kb (600,000 base pairs)

Example:
- Chromosome: 1
- Start: 1000000
- End: 1600000
- This creates a 600kb region on chromosome 1

The system will validate that your region is within the 600kb limit before processing.
```

#### Example 1.2: Selecting Modalities

**User:**
```
What modalities can I select for predictions?
```

**Assistant:**
```
The system supports the following prediction modalities:

**Epigenomic Features:**
- Epigenomic features (includes TF-bindings + 11 histone marks)
- Additional TF-bindings (extra transcription factors beyond the core set)

**Expression Assays:**
- RNA-seq
- RNA strand-specific
- GRO-seq
- GRO-cap
- PRO-seq
- TT-seq
- Bru-seq
- NET-CAGE

**Chromatin Structure:**
- Micro-C
- Hi-C
- Intact Hi-C

**Functional Assays:**
- STARR-seq

You can select multiple modalities for a single prediction run. The system will generate predictions for each selected modality.
```

#### Example 1.3: ATAC-seq Data Upload

**User:**
```
How do I use ATAC-seq data with predictions?
```

**Assistant:**
```
You can upload ATAC-seq data as a pickle file (.pickle format) when submitting a prediction request. The system will:

1. Accept the pickle file upload
2. Use the ATAC-seq data to inform predictions
3. Incorporate accessible chromatin information into the prediction models

The ATAC-seq data helps the system identify regions of accessible chromatin, which can improve prediction accuracy for epigenomic features and enhancer activity.

To use ATAC-seq data:
1. Prepare your ATAC-seq data as a pickle file
2. Upload it when creating a new analysis run
3. The system will automatically process and incorporate it
```

### Category 2: Understanding Prediction Results

#### Example 2.1: Understanding Score Values

**User:**
```
What does a score of 0.85 mean in an EFP prediction?
```

**Assistant:**
```
In an EFP (Epigenomic Feature Prediction) result from this system:

- **Score**: A value between 0 and 1 indicating the predicted signal strength
- **Score of 0.85**: This is a high score, indicating strong predicted signal for the epigenomic feature

The score represents the model's prediction of how strong the signal is for that particular feature (e.g., a histone mark or transcription factor binding) in the specified genomic region and cell type.

Higher scores (closer to 1.0) indicate stronger predicted signals, while lower scores (closer to 0.0) indicate weaker or absent signals.
```

#### Example 2.2: Understanding Confidence Levels

**User:**
```
What do High, Moderate, and Low confidence mean?
```

**Assistant:**
```
The confidence level in prediction results indicates how certain the model is about its prediction:

- **High confidence**: The model is very certain about this prediction. The input region and features strongly match patterns the model learned during training.

- **Moderate confidence**: The model is somewhat certain but there may be some ambiguity. The region may have mixed signals or be at the boundary of what the model was trained on.

- **Low confidence**: The model is uncertain about this prediction. This could be due to:
  - The region having features not well-represented in training data
  - Ambiguous signals in the input
  - The region being outside the model's optimal prediction range

Always consider confidence levels when interpreting results. High confidence predictions are more reliable than low confidence ones.
```

#### Example 2.3: Understanding Task Types

**User:**
```
What's the difference between EFP, GEP, and EAP predictions?
```

**Assistant:**
```
The system provides three types of prediction tasks:

**EFP (Epigenomic Feature Prediction):**
- Predicts transcription factor binding sites
- Predicts 11 different histone marks
- Provides scores for each epigenomic feature
- Used to understand chromatin state and regulatory elements

**GEP (Gene Expression Prediction):**
- Predicts gene expression levels
- Provides expression scores for genes in the region
- Can be combined with expression modalities (RNA-seq, GRO-seq, etc.)
- Indicates which genes are likely active

**EAP (Enhancer Activity Prediction):**
- Predicts enhancer activity scores
- Indicates regulatory potential of genomic regions
- Can be combined with STARR-seq modality
- Helps identify functional enhancers

Each task type provides different information about the genomic region. You can run multiple task types on the same region to get a comprehensive view.
```

#### Example 2.4: Understanding Classification Field

**User:**
```
What does the classification field in results mean?
```

**Assistant:**
```
The classification field provides a categorical label describing what type of genomic element or state the system predicts for the region.

For example:
- EFP results might classify regions as "Active promoter", "Enhancer", "Repressed region", etc.
- GEP results might classify as "Highly expressed", "Moderately expressed", "Low expression", etc.
- EAP results might classify as "Strong enhancer", "Weak enhancer", "Non-enhancer", etc.

The classification is derived from the prediction scores and provides a human-readable summary of what the model predicts for that region.
```

---

### Category 3: Model and System Information

#### Example 3.1: Model Version Information

**User:**
```
What does modelVersion and datasetVersion mean in results?
```

**Assistant:**
```
The prediction results include version information:

**modelVersion**: Indicates which version of the prediction model was used. Different model versions may have:
- Different architectures
- Improved accuracy
- Different training approaches
- Updated parameters

**datasetVersion**: Indicates which version of the training dataset was used. This is important because:
- Models trained on different datasets may produce different results
- Dataset versions may include updated or corrected data
- Helps track reproducibility

Both versions are included for transparency and to help you understand which model and training data produced your results. This is important for reproducibility and comparing results across different runs.
```

#### Example 3.2: Job Tracking

**User:**
```
What is a jobId and how do I use it?
```

**Assistant:**
```
Each prediction request creates a job with a unique jobId. The jobId:

1. **Identifies your specific prediction run**: Each job gets a unique identifier
2. **Tracks job status**: You can check if your job is queued, running, completed, or failed
3. **Links to results**: Once complete, you use the jobId to retrieve your results
4. **Enables job management**: You can track multiple prediction jobs simultaneously

When you submit a prediction:
- The system creates a job and assigns a jobId
- The job appears in your active jobs list
- You can monitor progress using the jobId
- Results are linked to the jobId when complete

Keep your jobId to reference your results later or check job status.
```

#### Example 3.3: Runtime Information

**User:**
```
What does the runtime field tell me?
```

**Assistant:**
```
The runtime field shows how long the prediction took to complete, measured from when the job started processing until it finished.

This information helps you:
- **Estimate wait times**: Similar regions may take similar time
- **Understand system load**: Longer runtimes might indicate high system usage
- **Plan your workflow**: Know approximately how long predictions take

Runtime depends on:
- Region size (larger regions may take longer)
- Number of modalities selected (more modalities = longer runtime)
- System load (queued jobs wait longer)
- Task type complexity

The runtime is recorded in the results for your reference.
```

### Category 4: Interpreting Combined Results

#### Example 4.1: Comparing Multiple Modalities

**User:**
```
I ran predictions with both RNA-seq and GRO-seq. How do I interpret them together?
```

**Assistant:**
```
When you run multiple expression modalities on the same region, you can compare them:

**RNA-seq predictions**: Show overall gene expression levels predicted by the model.

**GRO-seq predictions**: Show nascent transcription and identify active transcription start sites.

**How to interpret together:**
- If both show high scores: Strong agreement that the region has active transcription
- If RNA-seq is high but GRO-seq is low: May indicate mature transcripts but less active transcription initiation
- If GRO-seq is high but RNA-seq is moderate: May indicate active transcription initiation but moderate overall expression

The system provides separate scores for each modality. Compare the scores to understand different aspects of gene expression in your region.

Both predictions use the same input (genomic region, cell type) but predict different aspects of expression, so they complement each other.
```

#### Example 4.2: Epigenomic Features and Expression

**User:**
```
I have EFP results showing high H3K4me3 and GEP results showing high expression. What does this mean?
```

**Assistant:**
```
When EFP and GEP results agree:

**EFP showing high H3K4me3**: The model predicts strong H3K4me3 histone mark signal, which is associated with active promoters.

**GEP showing high expression**: The model predicts high gene expression levels.

**Together**: These results suggest the region contains an active promoter with high gene expression. The high H3K4me3 (an active promoter mark) aligns with the high expression prediction.

This type of agreement between different prediction types increases confidence in the results. When multiple predictions point to the same conclusion, it's more reliable than a single prediction.

Check the confidence levels of both predictions - if both are High confidence, this is a strong indication of an active promoter region.
```

#### Example 4.3: Chromatin Structure Predictions

**User:**
```
What's the difference between Hi-C and Micro-C predictions in my results?
```

**Assistant:**
```
The system provides separate predictions for Hi-C and Micro-C modalities:

**Hi-C predictions**: Show predicted chromatin contact frequencies at the resolution the model was trained on. Higher scores indicate stronger predicted contacts between genomic regions.

**Micro-C predictions**: Show predicted higher-resolution chromatin contacts. These may capture finer-scale interactions.

**In your results:**
- Both provide scores indicating predicted contact strength
- Both use the same input region and cell type
- They may show different scores because they predict different resolution scales

Compare the scores:
- If both are high: Strong agreement on chromatin interactions
- If they differ: May indicate resolution-specific interactions
- Check confidence levels: Higher confidence predictions are more reliable

The system provides these as separate predictions so you can analyze chromatin structure at different resolutions.
```

### Category 5: Error Handling and Limitations

#### Example 5.1: Region Size Limits

**User:**
```
Can I predict a region larger than 600kb?
```

**Assistant:**
```
No, the system has a maximum region size limit of 600kb (600,000 base pairs).

If you try to submit a region larger than 600kb:
- The system will reject the request
- You'll receive an error message
- You'll need to split your region into smaller segments

To work with larger regions:
1. Divide your region into 600kb or smaller segments
2. Submit separate prediction jobs for each segment
3. Combine the results manually if needed

The 600kb limit is a system constraint to ensure predictions complete in reasonable time and maintain accuracy.
```

#### Example 5.2: Invalid Chromosome

**User:**
```
What happens if I specify an invalid chromosome?
```

**Assistant:**
```
The system only accepts chromosomes 1-22, X, or Y.

If you specify an invalid chromosome:
- The system will reject the request
- You'll receive an error message indicating the chromosome is invalid
- The prediction job will not be created

Valid chromosomes are:
- Autosomes: 1, 2, 3, ..., 22
- Sex chromosomes: X, Y

Make sure to use one of these valid chromosome identifiers when submitting predictions.
```

#### Example 5.3: Low Confidence Results

**User:**
```
My prediction has Low confidence. Should I trust it?
```

**Assistant:**
```
Low confidence predictions indicate the model is uncertain about the result. You should interpret them cautiously:

**What Low confidence means:**
- The input region may have features not well-represented in training data
- The region may be ambiguous or have mixed signals
- The prediction may be less reliable

**What to do:**
1. **Check the region**: Verify your coordinates are correct
2. **Check cell type**: Ensure you selected the appropriate cell type
3. **Consider the score**: Even with low confidence, the score direction (high/low) may still be informative
4. **Compare with other predictions**: If other modalities or task types show high confidence, those are more reliable
5. **Re-run if needed**: If the region seems correct, the low confidence may be inherent to that region

Low confidence doesn't mean the prediction is wrong, but it means you should be more cautious and consider additional evidence before drawing conclusions.
```

### Category 6: System Workflow

#### Example 6.1: Complete Prediction Workflow

**User:**
```
Walk me through how to get predictions for a genomic region.
```

**Assistant:**
```
Here's the complete workflow for getting predictions:

1. **Specify Genomic Region**:
   - Choose chromosome (1-22, X, or Y)
   - Enter start coordinate
   - Enter end coordinate
   - Ensure region is ≤600kb

2. **Select Cell Type**:
   - Choose the cell type you want predictions for
   - Different cell types may produce different results

3. **Select Modalities**:
   - Choose which prediction types you want (EFP, GEP, EAP, or specific modalities)
   - You can select multiple modalities

4. **Optional: Upload ATAC-seq Data**:
   - If you have ATAC-seq data, upload the pickle file
   - This can improve prediction accuracy

5. **Submit the Job**:
   - The system creates a job and assigns a jobId
   - Your job appears in the active jobs list

6. **Monitor Progress**:
   - Check job status (queued, running, completed, failed)
   - Wait for completion

7. **View Results**:
   - Once complete, view results with:
     - Scores for each prediction
     - Confidence levels
     - Classification
     - Model and dataset versions
     - Runtime information

The system handles the prediction computation and returns structured results you can analyze.
```

#### Example 6.2: Checking Job Status

**User:**
```
How do I know if my prediction job is done?
```

**Assistant:**
```
You can check job status in several ways:

1. **Active Jobs List**: View all your running jobs with their status:
   - **Queued**: Job is waiting to start
   - **Running**: Job is currently processing
   - **Completed**: Job finished successfully
   - **Failed**: Job encountered an error

2. **Job Progress**: For running jobs, you can see progress percentage

3. **Job ID**: Use your jobId to check specific job status

4. **Results Page**: Completed jobs appear in your results list

When a job status changes to "Completed", your results are ready. If it shows "Failed", check the error message for details about what went wrong.

Jobs typically process in the order they were submitted, but runtime varies based on region size, modalities selected, and system load.
```
